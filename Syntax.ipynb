        "Understanding a native language is one of the most natural skills. We produce and consume words just as easily as we breathe. However, understanding a language is a complex process. There are words, that have multiple meanings. We hide the true meaning behind jokes or sarcasm. But we can take advantage of the context, we have some sense of humor, and we know what sarcasm is. Despite all these challenges, we usually get the meaning. Do computers get it? Well, this is one of the biggest challenges in Natural Language Processing. \n",
